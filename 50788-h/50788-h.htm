<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><i>Prussia joined in a Guarantee of Belgian Neutrality.</i></p>

<p>The neutrality of Belgium was guaranteed by a treaty signed
in 1839 to which France, Prussia and Great Britain were parties.</p>


<p><i>Recent German Assurances.</i></p>

<p>In 1913 the German Secretary of State, at a meeting of a
Budget Committee of the Reichstag, declared that "Belgian
neutrality is provided for by international conventions, and
Germany is determined to respect those conventions."</p>

<p>On July 31st, 1914, when the danger of war between Germany
and France seemed imminent, Herr von Below, the German
Minister in Brussels, being interrogated by the Belgian Foreign
Department, replied that he knew of the assurances given by
the German Chancellor in 1911 (that Germany had no intention
of violating Belgian neutrality) and that he "was certain that
the sentiments expressed at that time had not changed."</p>


<p><i>Passage through Belgium Demanded by Germany.</i></p>

<p>Nevertheless, on August 2nd, the same Minister presented
a note to the Belgian Government demanding a passage through
Belgium for the German Army on pain of an instant declaration
of war.</p>


<p><i>Passage Refused by Belgian King and Government.</i></p>

<p>Startled as they were by the suddenness with which this
terrific war cloud had risen on the eastern horizon, the leaders
of the nation rallied round the King of Belgium in his resolution
to refuse the demand and to prepare for resistance.</p>


<p><i>Invasion.</i></p>

<p>On the evening of August 3rd, the German troops crossed
the frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Early Outbreak of Atrocities.</i></p>

<p>No sooner had the Germans violated Belgian territory, than
statements of atrocities committed by German soldiers against
civilians&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;found their way into the
newspapers of this country. The public could hardly believe the
record of cruelty that rapidly accumulated, but the persistence
with which reports from one district tallied in general outline
with reports from other localities left little doubt in the public
mind as to the truth of the alleged atrocities. But it became
necessary to make absolutely certain of the facts.</p>


<p><i>Home Office Collected Evidence.</i></p>

<p>The Home Office, in the autumn of 1914, wisely decided to
collect evidence of the truth, and, during the concluding months
of 1914, a great number of statements taken in writing were
collected from Belgian witnesses (mostly civilians), and from
British officers and soldiers. The statements were taken by
the staff of the Director of Public Prosecutions and a number
of barristers who assisted the Home Office.</p>


<p><i>Government Appointed a Committee to Investigate&mdash;Terms
of Reference.</i></p>

<p>On December 15th, 1914, the Government took the important
step of appointing a Committee:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>"To consider and advise on the evidence collected on behalf
of His Majesty's Government, as to outrages alleged
to have been committed by German troops during
the present war, cases of alleged maltreatment of
civilians in the invaded territories, and breaches of
the laws and established usages of war; and to prepare
a report for His Majesty's Government showing the
conclusion at which they arrive on the evidence now
available."</b></p></blockquote>


<p><i>Careful Selection of Members of Committee.</i></p>

<p>In order that the findings of the Committee should command
the confidence of the public, the Government was careful to
appoint upon it men whose judicial outlook, training and experience
for their responsible task could not be questioned.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Viscount Bryce</span>, O.M., the distinguished
British Ambassador at Washington from 1907 to 1912,
was appointed Chairman, and the other members of
the Committee were:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Sir Frederick Pollock</span>, Bart., who was
Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University,
1883-1903, and is Judge of the Admiralty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Court of Cinque Ports. He is one of the leading authorities
on the laws of this country;</p>

<p>The Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Sir Edward Clarke</span>, K.C., was Member of
Parliament for Plymouth (20 years) and London City
(1906); was Solicitor-General from 1886 to 1902;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Kenelm Digby</span>, G.C.B., K.C., who was a County Court
Judge from 1892 to 1894, and Permanent Under-Secretary
of the Home Office from 1895 to 1903;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Alfred Hopkinson</span>, K.C., LL.D., represented Manchester
and North Wiltshire in the House of Commons;
was Principal of Owens College, Manchester, from
1898 to 1904; and Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University,
Manchester, from 1900 to 1913;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. H. A. L. Fisher</span>, Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Sheffield;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Harold Cox</span>, the well-known Journalist and Editor of
the "Edinburgh Review," who represented Preston in
the House of Commons from 1906 to 1910.</p></blockquote>


<p><i>How the Committee Worked.</i></p>

<p>The Committee laboured for three months, examining the
evidence, and more than 1,200 statements made by witnesses
were considered. These depositions were in all cases taken
down in this country by gentlemen of legal knowledge and
experience, and the greatest care was exercised in the task.</p>


<p><i>Doubt Removed as Work Proceeded.</i></p>

<p>The Committee approached their responsible task in a spirit
of doubt, but, to use their own words, "the further we went
and the more evidence we examined, so much the more was our
scepticism reduced.... When we found that things which
had at first seemed improbable were testified to by many witnesses
coming from different places, having had no communication with
one another, and knowing nothing of one another's statements,
the points in which they all agreed became more and more evidently
true. And when this concurrence of testimony, this
convergence upon what were substantially the same broad facts,
showed itself in hundreds of depositions, <b>the truth of those broad
facts stood out beyond question</b>."</p>


<p><i>Fairness of Witnesses' Evidence.</i></p>

<p>The Committee expected "to find much of the evidence
coloured by passion, or prompted by an excited fancy. But
they were impressed by the general moderation and matter-of-fact
level-headedness of the witnesses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<p><i>No desire to "Make a Case."</i></p>

<p>Nor could the Committee, in examining the depositions,
"detect the trace of any desire to 'make a case' against the
German Army." "In one respect, the most weighty part of
the evidence," according to the Committee, consisted of the
diaries kept by the German soldiers themselves.</p>


<p><i>A Terrible Record.</i></p>

<p>The Report of the Committee, with the Appendix, covers
240 foolscap pages. These 240 pages of cold, judicial print
make a terrible indictment against a so-called Civilised Power&mdash;and
one, moreover, whose home is not in "Darkest Africa,"
but in the very heart of enlightened Europe.</p>

<p>In this pamphlet space will only permit of the insertion of
the Findings of the Committee, and of some examples taken
from the Report. <i>Those who seek fuller information should obtain
one or other edition of the official Report and Appendix, particulars
of which are given on the cover of this pamphlet.</i></p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that this terrible record embraces
a part only of the area in the occupation of German troops, and
is based mainly on the statements of Belgian refugees <i>in this
country</i>. If it had been possible to extend the enquiry, and to
get evidence from the Belgians and the French now inhabiting
the districts occupied by Germany, there is no doubt that the
volume of evidence would have been much greater.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>For the purpose of this short pamphlet, the methodical
arrangement in geographical areas followed in the Report has been
abandoned, and a simpler grouping adopted. The whole of the
language, however, in the following pages (apart from the headings)

altered, except where an explanation is required, in which case the

<h2>1. CIVILIANS MURDERED AND ILL-TREATED.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The Care of the Belgian Civil Authorities to Collect Firearms
from Civilians and to Warn them against taking part in
the Hostilities.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">7</div>

<p>The Belgian King and Government were aware of the danger
which would confront the civilian population of the country if
it were tempted to take part in the work of national defence.
Orders were accordingly issued by the civil governors of provinces,
and by the burgomasters of towns, that the civilian inhabitants
were to take no part in hostilities, and to offer no provocation
to the invaders. That no excuse might be furnished for severities,
the populations of many important towns were instructed to
surrender all firearms into the hands of the local officials.</p>


<p><i>The Kindness extended to the Invading Germans by the Civil
Population of Belgium.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">26</div>

<p>Letters written to their homes, which have been found on the
bodies of dead Germans, bear witness, in a way that now sounds
pathetic, to the kindness with which they were received by the
civil population. Their evident surprise at this reception
was due to the stories which had been dinned into their ears of
soldiers with their eyes gouged out, treacherous murders and
poisoned food.</p>


<p><i>Outbreak of Atrocities from the Moment the German Army
crossed the Frontier.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>Murder, rape, arson and pillage began from the moment when
the German Army crossed the frontier. For the first fortnight
of the war, the towns and villages near Liège were the chief
sufferers.... There is a certain significance in the fact
that the outrages round Liège coincide with the unexpected
resistance of the Belgian Army in that district, and that the
slaughter which reigned from August 19th to the end of the month
is contemporaneous with the period when the German Army's
need for a quick passage through Belgium at all costs was deemed
imperative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Article 46 of the Second International Peace Conference (Convention concerning
the Laws and Customs of War on Land), held at the Hague in 1907,
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Family honour and rights, individual life, and private property, as well as
religious convictions and worship, must be respected.</i></p>

<p><i>Private property may not be confiscated.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Instances from Herve and Melen.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">7</div>

<p>"On the 4th of August," says one witness, "at Herve" (a
village not far from the frontier), "I saw at about 2 o'clock in
the afternoon, near the station, five Uhlans [German cavalry];
these were the first German troops I had seen. They were
followed by a German officer and some soldiers in a motor car.
The men in the car called out to a couple of young fellows who
were standing about 30 yards away. The young men, being
afraid, ran off, and then the Germans fired and killed one of them
named D&mdash;&mdash;." The murder of this innocent fugitive civilian
was a prelude to the burning and pillage of Herve and of other
villages in the neighbourhood, to the indiscriminate shooting of
civilians of both sexes, and to the organised military execution
of batches of selected males. Thus at Herve some 50 men
escaping from the burning houses were seized, taken outside the
town and shot. At Melen, a hamlet west of Herve, 40 men were
shot. In one household alone the father and mother (names
given) were shot, the daughter died after being outraged, and
the son was wounded.</p>


<p><i>The Slaughter of Civilians speedily became a Custom.</i></p>

<p>The burning of the villages in this neighbourhood, and the
wholesale slaughter of civilians, such as occurred at Herve,
Micheroux and Soumagne appear to be connected with the
exasperation caused by the resistance of Fort Fléron, whose guns
barred the main road from Aix-la-Chapelle to Liège. Enraged
by the losses which they had sustained, suspicious of the temper
of the civilian population, and probably thinking that by exceptional
severities at the outset they could cow the spirit of the
Belgian nation, the German officers and men speedily accustomed
themselves to the slaughter of civilians.</p>


<p><i>No Official German Denial of Atrocities.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>Citizens of neutral states who visited Belgium in December
and January report that the German authorities do not deny that
non-combatants were systematically killed in large numbers
during the first weeks of the invasion, and this, so far as we know,
has never been officially denied.</p>


<p><i>Flight of Belgian Refugees without Parallel.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>If it were denied, the flight and continued voluntary exile of
thousands of Belgian refugees would go far to contradict a denial,
for there is no historical parallel in modern times for the flight
of a large part of a nation before an invader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<p><i>German Government seek to justify Severities, but no Proof
given of Alleged Firing by Civilians.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>The German Government have, however, sought to justify
their severities on the grounds of military necessity, and have
excused them as retaliation for cases in which civilians fired on
German troops. There may have been cases in which such
firing occurred, but no proof has ever been given, or, to our
knowledge, attempted to be given, of such cases, nor of the
allegations of shocking outrages perpetrated by Belgian men
and women on German soldiers.</p>


<p><i>On the contrary, Civilians were Warned after the Invasion.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">26</div>

<p>The inherent improbability of the German contention is shown
by the fact that after the first few days of the invasion every
possible precaution had been taken by the Belgian authorities,
by way of placards and handbills, to warn the civilian population
not to intervene in hostilities.</p>


<p><i>Civilians Shot Indiscriminately and without any Inquiry.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">26</div>

<p>An invading army may be entitled to shoot at sight a civilian
caught red-handed, or anyone who though not caught red-handed
is proved guilty on inquiry. But this was not the practice
followed by the German troops. They do not seem to have made
any inquiry. They seized the civilians of the village indiscriminately
and killed them, or such as they selected from among them,
without the least regard to guilt or innocence. The mere cry
"Civilisten haben geschossen" ("Civilians have been shooting")
was enough to hand over a whole village or district, and even
outlying places, to ruthless slaughter.</p>


<p><i>Killing of Civilians on Scale without any Parallel in Modern
Warfare between Civilised Powers.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>In the present war&mdash;and this is the gravest charge against
the German Army&mdash;the evidence shows that the killing of non-combatants
was carried out to an extent for which no previous
war between nations claiming to be civilised furnishes any precedent.</p>


<p><i>Mass of Evidence convinced Committee of its Truth.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>That these acts should have been perpetrated on the peaceful
population of an unoffending country which was not at war with
its invaders, but merely defending its own neutrality, guaranteed
by the invading Power, may excite amazement and even incredulity.
It was with amazement and almost with incredulity
that the Committee first read the depositions relating to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
acts. But when the evidence regarding Liège was followed by
that regarding Aerschot, Louvain, Andenne, Dinant and the
other towns and villages, the cumulative effect of such a mass
of concurrent testimony became irresistible, and the Committee
were driven to the conclusion that the things described had really
happened.</p>


<p><i>Killing of Civilians deliberately planned by the Higher Military
Authorities and carried out methodically.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>The excesses recently committed in Belgium were, moreover,
too widespread and too uniform in their character to be mere
sporadic outbursts of passion or rapacity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>That this killing was done as part of a deliberate plan is clear
from the facts set forth regarding Louvain, Aerschot, Dinant
and other towns. The killing was done under orders in each
place. It began at a certain fixed date, and stopped (with some
few exceptions) at another fixed date.</p>


<p><i>German Army Disciplined to Obey.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>The discipline of the German Army is proverbially stringent,
and its obedience implicit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p>It was to the discipline rather than the want of discipline in
the Army that these outrages, which we are obliged to describe
as systematic, were due, and the special official notices posted
on certain houses that they were not to be destroyed show the
fate which had been decreed for the others which were not so
marked.</p>


<p><i>A few German Officers showed Feelings of Humanity.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>The Committee gladly record the instances where the evidence
shows that humanity had not wholly disappeared from some
members of the German Army, and that they realised that the
responsible heads of that organisation were employing them,
not in war, but in butchery. "I am merely executing orders,
and I should be shot if I did not execute them," said an officer
to a witness at Louvain. At Brussels another officer said: "I
have not done one hundredth part of what we have been ordered
to do by the High German military authorities."</p>

<div class="sidenote">30</div>

<p>A humane German officer, witnessing the ruin of Aerschot,
exclaimed in disgust: "I am a father myself, and I cannot bear
this. It is not war, but butchery."</p>


<p><i>Drink Responsible for many of the Worst Outrages.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<div class="sidenote">30</div>

<p>Many of the worst outrages appear to have been perpetrated
by men under the influence of drink. Unfortunately, little seems
to have been done to repress this source of danger.... Officers
as well as men succumbed to the temptation of drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The German Army is Responsible for Crimes which it did
not Check.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>When an army is directed or permitted to kill non-combatants
on a large scale, the ferocity of the worse natures springs into
fuller life, and both lust and the thirst of blood become more widespread
and more formidable. Had less licence been allowed to the
soldiers, and had they not been set to work to slaughter civilians,
there would have been fewer of those painful cases in which a
depraved and morbid cruelty appears.</p>


<p><i>The Taking and Murder of Hostages.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>Two classes of murders in particular require special mention,
because one of them is almost new, and the other altogether
unprecedented. The former is the seizure of peaceful citizens
as so-called hostages to be kept as a pledge for the conduct of
the civil population, or as a means to secure some military advantage,
or to compel the payment of a contribution, the hostages
being shot if the condition imposed by the arbitrary will of the
invader is not fulfilled. Such hostage taking ... is opposed both
to the rules of war and to every principle of justice and humanity.</p>


<p><i>Murder in the Villages.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">27</div>

<p>The latter kind of murder is the killing of the innocent inhabitants
of a village because shots have been fired, or are alleged to
have been fired, on the troops by someone in the village. For
this practice no previous example and no justification has been or
can be pleaded.... In Belgium large bodies of men, sometimes
including the burgomaster and the priest, were seized,
marched by officers to a spot chosen for the purpose, and there
shot in cold blood, without any attempt at trial or even enquiry,
under the pretence of inflicting punishment upon the village,
though these unhappy victims were not even charged with
having themselves committed any wrongful act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16</div>

<p>The Committee is specially impressed by the character of the
outrages committed in the smaller villages.</p>

<p><i>Aerschot and District</i> (August 25th).&mdash;Immediately after the
battle of Malines ... a long series of murders were committed
either just before or during the retreat of the army. Many
of the inhabitants who were unarmed, including women and
young children, were killed&mdash;some of them under revolting circumstances.</p>

<p>Evidence given goes to show that the death of these villagers
was due, not to accident, but to deliberate purpose.</p>


<p><i>A Death-stricken Area.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">14</div>

<p>The quadrangle of territory bounded by the towns of Aerschot,
Malines, Vilvorde, and Louvain, is a rich agricultural tract,
studded with small villages and comprising two considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cities, Louvain and Malines. This district on August 19th passed
into the hands of the Germans, and, owing perhaps to its proximity
to Antwerp, then the seat of the Belgian Government and headquarters
of the Belgian Army, it became from that date a scene of
chronic outrage, with respect to which the Committee has received
a great mass of evidence.</p>


<p><i>Systematic Massacres.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">14</div>

<p>The arrival of the Germans in the district on August 19th was
marked by systematic massacres and other outrages at Aerschot
itself, Gelrode and some other villages.</p>


<p><i>Sudden Outburst of Cruelty follows Belgian Victory.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">14</div>

<p>On August 25th the Belgians, sallying out of the defences of
Antwerp, attacked the German positions at Malines, drove the
enemy from the town and re-occupied many of the villages in
the neighbourhood. And just as numerous outrages against the
civilian population had been the immediate consequence of the
temporary repulse of the German vanguard from Fort Fléron,
so a large body of depositions testify to the fact that a sudden
outburst of cruelty was the response of the German Army to the
Belgian victory at Malines.</p>


<p><i>A Reign of Terror.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">14</div>

<p>The battle of Malines ... was the occasion of numerous murders
committed by the German Army in retreating through the
villages of Sempst, Hofstade, Eppeghem, Elewyt and elsewhere.
In the second place it led ... to the massacres, plunderings and
burnings at Louvain, the signal for which was provided by shots
exchanged between the German Army, retreating after its repulse
at Malines, and some members of the German garrison of Louvain,
who mistook their fellow countrymen for Belgians. Lastly, the
encounter at Malines seems to have stung the Germans into
establishing a reign of terror in so much of the district comprised
in the quadrangle as remained in their power.</p>


<p><i>Louvain Peacefully Occupied by Germans for Six Days.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p><i>Louvain and District.</i>&mdash;The events spoken to as having
occurred in and around Louvain between August 19th and 25th
deserve close attention.</p>

<p>For six days the Germans were in peaceful occupation of the
city. No houses were set on fire&mdash;no citizens killed. There
was a certain amount of looting of empty houses, but otherwise
discipline was effectively maintained. The condition of Louvain
during these days was one of relative peace and quietude, presenting
a striking contrast to the previous and contemporaneous
conduct of the German Army elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<p><i>A Sudden Change&mdash;Murder of Civilians and Destruction of
Property.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p>On the evening of August 25th a sudden change took place.
The Germans, on that day repulsed by the Belgians, had retreated
to and re-occupied Louvain. Immediately the devastation of
that city and the destruction by fire of its population began.</p>


<p><i>Defeated Germans Revenge themselves on Civilians.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p>The inference is irresistible that the Army as a whole wreaked
its vengeance on the civilian population and the buildings of the
city in revenge for the setback which the Belgian arms had inflicted
on them. A subsidiary cause alleged was the assertion, often
made before, that civilians had fired upon the German Army.</p>

<p>The depositions which relate to Louvain are numerous, and
are believed by the Committee to present a true and fairly complete
picture of the events of August 25th and 26th and subsequent
days.</p>


<p><i>Civilians did not Fire.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p>The Committee find no grounds for thinking that the inhabitants
fired upon the German Army on the evening of August 25th.
Eye-witnesses worthy of credence detail exactly when, where
and how the firing commenced. Such firing was by Germans on
Germans. No impartial tribunal could, so the Committee think,
come to any other conclusion.</p>


<p><i>Harried Villagers.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">21</div>

<p>The massacre of civilians at Louvain was not confined to its
citizens. Large crowds of people were brought into Louvain
from the surrounding districts.... Of the hundreds of
people taken from the various villages and brought to Louvain
as prisoners, some were massacred there, others were forced to
march along with citizens of Louvain through various places,
some being ultimately sent on the 29th to the Belgian lines at
Malines, others were taken in trucks to Cologne, others were
released.</p>


<p><i>A Calculated Policy of Cruelty.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p>The Committee are driven to the conclusion that the harrying
of the villages in the district, the burning of a large part of
Louvain, the massacres there, the marching out of the prisoners,
and the transport to Cologne&mdash;all done without enquiry as to
whether the particular persons seized or killed had committed
any wrongful act&mdash;were due to a calculated policy carried out
scientifically and deliberately, not merely with the sanction
but under the direction of higher military authorities, and were
not due to any provocation or resistance by the civilian population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<p><i>The Tragedy of Beautiful Dinant.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">13</div>

<p>Just outside the prison one witness saw three lines of bodies,
which he recognised as being those of neighbours. They were
nearly all dead, but he noticed movement in some of them.
There were about 120 bodies.... Unarmed civilians were
killed in masses at other places near the prison. About 90 bodies
were seen lying on the top of one another in a grass square
opposite the convent. They included many relatives of a witness....
It is stated that, beside the 90 corpses referred to
above, 60 corpses of civilians were recovered from a hole in the
brewery yard, and that 48 bodies of women and children were
found in a garden.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Committee have no reason to believe that the civilian
population of Dinant gave any provocation, or that any other
defence can be put forward to justify the treatment inflicted
upon its citizens.</p>

<p>As regards this town and the advance of the German Army
from Dinant to Rethel on the Aisne, a graphic account is given
in the diary of a Saxon officer. This diary confirms what is clear
from the evidence as a whole both as regards these and other
districts&mdash;that civilians were constantly taken as prisoners,
often dragged from their homes and shot under the direction of
the authorities without any charge being made against them.
An event of the kind is thus referred to in a diary entry:
"Apparently 200 men were shot. There must have been some
innocent men amongst them. In future we shall have to hold an
enquiry as to their guilt instead of shooting them." The shooting
of inhabitants&mdash;women and children as well as men&mdash;went on
after the Germans had passed Dinant on their way into France.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Further Examples of the Treatment of Civilians.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">9</div>

<p>Entries in a German diary show that on August 19th the
German soldiers gave themselves up to debauchery in the streets
of Liège, and on the night of the 20th (Thursday) a massacre took
place in the streets.... The Belgian witnesses vehemently
deny that there had been any provocation given, some stating
that many German soldiers were drunk, others giving evidence
which indicates that the affair was planned beforehand. It is
stated that at 5 o'clock in the evening, long before the shooting,
a citizen was warned by a friendly German soldier not to go out
that night.</p>

<p>Though the cause of the massacre is in dispute, the results
are known with certainty.... Many inhabitants were
burnt alive in their houses, their efforts to escape being prevented
by rifle fire. Twenty people were shot while trying to escape,
before the eyes of one of the witnesses.... Thirty-two
civilians were killed on that day, the 21st, in the Place de l'Université
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">20</div>

<p><i>Louvain.</i>&mdash;On August 26th (Wednesday) massacre, fire and
destruction went on.... Citizens were shot and others
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Soldiers went through the streets saying "Man hat geschossen."
("They have been shooting.") One soldier was seen going
along shooting in the air.... Some citizens were shot on
opening the doors, others in endeavouring to escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21</div>

<p>These prisoners [civilians] were practically without food
from early morning on the 26th until midnight on the 29th.
Of the corpses seen on the road some had their hands tied behind
their backs, others were burnt, some had been killed by blows.</p>

<p>"I did not dare to look at the dead bodies in the street, there
were so many of them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p>"The officers were worse than the men.... We had
had nothing to eat or drink since the evening of the day before.
A few compassionate soldiers gave us water to drink, but no
official took the trouble to see that we were fed."</p>

<div class="sidenote">24</div>

<p><i>Louvain</i> (German soldier's diary&mdash;No. 32).&mdash;"180 inhabitants
are stated to have been shot after they had dug their own graves."</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p><i>Surice.</i>&mdash;On August 24th and 25th massacres were carried
out in which many persons belonging to the professional classes
as well as others were killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p><i>Namur</i> was entered on August 24th. The troops signalised
their entry by firing on a crowd of 150 unarmed, unresisting
civilians, 10 alone of whom escaped.... As the inhabitants
fled from the burning houses they were shot by the German
troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p>In <i>Tamines</i>, a large village on the Meuse between Namur and
Charleroi, the advance guard of the German Army appeared in
the first fortnight in August, and in this, as well as in other villages
in the district, it is proved that a large number of civilians,
among them aged people, women and children, were deliberately
killed by the soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21</div>

<p><i>Tirlemont.</i>&mdash;The prisoners, of whom there are said to have
been thousands, were not allowed even to have water to drink,
although there were streams on the way from which the soldiers
drank. Witness was given some milk at a farm, but as she raised
it to her lips it was taken away from her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22</div>

<p><i>Journeys from Louvain to Cologne.</i>&mdash;Some of the trucks were
abominably filthy. Prisoners were not allowed to leave to obey
the calls of nature.... They were, in all, eight days in
the train, crowded and almost without food. Two of the men
went mad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p><i>Termonde.</i>&mdash;About 70 prisoners ... were taken to Lebbeke,
where there were in all 300 prisoners, and there they were locked
up in the church for three days and with scarcely any food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p><i>Ermeton</i> (Diary No. 19).&mdash;The exact translation of the extract,
grim in its brevity, is as follows: "August 24/14. We took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
about 1,000 prisoners; at least 500 were shot. The village
was burnt because inhabitants had also shot. Two civilians were
shot at once."</p>

<div class="sidenote">9</div>

<p><i>Wandre</i> (Diary of German soldier&mdash;Eitel Anders).&mdash;"In
one house a whole collection of weapons was found. The
inhabitants without exception were brought out and shot. This
shooting was heart-breaking, as they all knelt down and prayed;
but that was no ground for mercy. A few shots rang out, and
they fell back into the green grass and slept for ever."</p>

<div class="sidenote">10</div>

<p><i>Andenne.</i>&mdash;Almost immediately, the slaughter of these inhabitants
began, and continued for over two hours, and intermittently
during the night. Machine guns were brought into
play. The German troops were said to be for the most part
drunk, and they certainly murdered and ravaged unchecked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p>About 400 people lost their lives in this massacre....
Eight men belonging to one family were murdered. Another
man was placed close to a machine gun, which was fired through
him. His wife brought his body home on a wheelbarrow. The
Germans broke into her house and ransacked it, and piled up all
the eatables in a heap on the floor and relieved themselves upon
it. A hair-dresser was murdered in his kitchen, where he was
sitting with a child on each knee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12</div>

<p><i>Montigny-sur-Sambre.</i>&mdash;On the Monday morning 27 civilians
from one parish alone were seen lying dead in the hospital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12</div>

<p>At <i>Monceau-sur-Sambre</i>, on August 21st, a young man of 18
was shot in his garden. His father and brother were seized in
their house and shot in the courtyard of a neighbouring country
house. The son was shot first. The father was compelled to
stand close to the feet of his son's corpse and to fix his eyes upon
him while he himself was shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p>At <i>Temploux</i>, on August 23rd, a Professor of Modern Languages
at the College of Namur was shot at his front door by a
German officer. Before he died he asked the officer the reason
for this brutality, and the officer replied that he had lost his
temper because some civilians had fired upon the Germans as
they entered the village. This allegation was not proved....
After the murder the house was burnt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17</div>

<p><i>Elewyt.</i>&mdash;A man's naked body was tied up to a ring in the
wall in the backyard of a house. He was dead, and his corpse
was mutilated in a manner too horrible to record. A woman's
naked body was also found in a stable abutting on the same
backyard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24</div>

<p>Bombardier Wetzel, of the 2nd Mounted Battery, 1st Kurhessian
Field Artillery Regiment, No. 11, records an incident which
happened in French territory near Lille on October 11th: "We
had no fight, but we caught about 20 men and shot them." By
this time killing not in a fight would seem to have passed into a
habit.</p>

<h2>2. WOMEN MURDERED AND OUTRAGED.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">30</div>

<p>From the very first women were not safe. At Liège women
and children were chased about the street by soldiers. One
witness gives a story, very circumstantial in its details, of how
women were publicly raped in the market place of the city, five
young German officers assisting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p><i>Tamines.</i>&mdash;A witness describes how he saw the public square
littered with corpses, and after a search found those of his wife
and child, a little girl of 7.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24</div>

<p><i>Wetteren Hospital.</i>&mdash;At this hospital was an old woman of
80 completely transfixed by a bayonet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17</div>

<p><i>Sempst.</i>&mdash;Witness saw a girl of 17 dressed only in a chemise
and in great distress. She alleged that she herself and other
girls had been dragged into a field, stripped naked and violated,
and that some of them had then been killed with the bayonet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17</div>

<p><i>Eppeghem.</i>&mdash;On August 25th a pregnant woman who had
been wounded with a bayonet was discovered in the convent.
She was dying.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p><i>Louvain.</i>&mdash;"In the middle of the night I heard a knock at
the outer door of the stable, which led into a little street, and
heard a woman's voice crying for help. I opened the door, and
just as I was going to let her in, a rifle shot fired from the street
by a German soldier rang out and the woman fell dead at my feet."</p>

<div class="sidenote">21</div>

<p>The wife of a witness ... was separated from him, and she
saw other ladies made to walk before the soldiers with their hands
above their heads. One, an old lady of 85 (name given) was
dragged from her cellar and taken with them to the station.</p>

<p>"I saw the corpses of some women in the street. I fell down,
and a woman who had been shot fell on top of me.... One
woman whom I saw lying dead in the street was a Miss &mdash;&mdash;
about 35. I also saw the body of &mdash;&mdash; (a woman). She had
been shot. I saw an officer pull her corpse underneath a wagon."</p>

<div class="sidenote">13</div>

<p><i>Dinant.</i>&mdash;He found his wife lying on the floor in a room.
She had bullet wounds in four places, but was alive, and told
her husband to return to the children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30</div>

<p>Sixty women and children were confined in the cellar of a
convent from Sunday morning till the following Friday (August
28th), sleeping on the ground, for there were no beds, with nothing
to drink during the whole period, and given no food until the
Wednesday, "when somebody threw into the cellar two sticks
of macaroni and a carrot for each prisoner."</p>

<div class="sidenote">16</div>

<p>In <i>Malines</i> itself many bodies were seen. One witness saw a
German soldier cut a woman's breasts after he had murdered
her, and saw many other dead bodies of women in the streets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16</div>

<p><i>Gelrode.</i>&mdash;A woman was shot by some German soldiers as

to dig a grave and bury my mistress. My master and the officer
went into the garden, the officer threatening my master with a
pistol. My master was then forced to dig the grave, and to bury
the body of my mistress in it. I cannot say for what reason they
killed my mistress. The officer who did it was singing all the

<h2>3. THE MURDER AND ILL-TREATMENT
OF CHILDREN.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">32</div>

<p>There can be no possible defence for the murder of children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">33</div>

<p>Whether or no Belgian civilians fired on German soldiers,
young children, at any rate, did not fire. The number and
character of these murders constitute the most distressing
feature connected with the conduct of the war so far as it is
revealed in the depositions submitted to the Committee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">32</div>

<p>It is clearly shown that many offences were committed against
infants and quite young children. On one occasion children
were even roped together and used as a military screen against
the enemy, on another three soldiers went into action carrying
small children to protect themselves from flank fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18</div>

<p>At <i>Haecht</i> several children had been murdered; one of two
or three years old was found nailed to the door of a farmhouse
by its hands and feet, a crime which seems almost incredible,
but the evidence for which we feel bound to accept. In the
garden of this house was the body of a girl who had been shot
in the forehead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18</div>

<p><i>Capelle-au-Bois.</i>&mdash;Two children were murdered in a cart, and
their corpses were seen by many witnesses at different stages of
the cart's journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p><i>Tamines.</i>&mdash;One witness describes how she saw a Belgian
boy of fifteen shot on the village green, and a day or two later
on the same green a little girl and her two brothers (name given)
who were looking at the German soldiers were killed before her
eyes for no apparent reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17</div>

<p><i>Boort Meerbeek.</i>&mdash;A German soldier was seen to fire three times
at a little girl of five years old. Having failed to hit her, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
subsequently bayoneted her. He was killed with the butt end
of a rifle by a Belgian soldier who had seen him commit this
murder from a distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17</div>

<p><i>Weerde.</i>&mdash;Two children were killed in a village&mdash;apparently
Weerde&mdash;quite wantonly as they were standing in the road with
their mother. They were three or four years old, and were
killed with the bayonet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p><i>Eppeghem.</i>&mdash;The dead body of a child of two was seen pinned

<p><i>Louvain</i> (August 28th).&mdash;One woman went mad, some children
died, others were born.... (August 29th, outside
Louvain): Some corpses were those of children who had been
shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30</div>

<p><i>A small village.</i>&mdash;There were two little children&mdash;a boy about
4 or 5, and a girl of about 6 or 7. The boy's left hand was cut
off at the wrist and the girl's right hand at the same place. They
were both quite dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">32</div>

<p><i>Malines.</i>&mdash;"One day when the Germans were not actually
bombarding the town, I left my house to go to my mother's house
in High Street. My husband was with me. I saw eight German
soldiers, and they were drunk. They were singing and making
a lot of noise and dancing about. As the German soldiers came
along the street I saw a small child, whether boy or girl I could
not see, come out of a house. The child was about 2 years of
age. The child came into the middle of the street so as to be
in the way of the soldiers. The soldiers were walking in twos.
The first line of two passed the child. One of the second line,
the man on the left, stepped aside and drove his bayonet with
both hands into the child's stomach, lifting the child into the
air on his bayonet and carrying it away on his bayonet, he and
his comrades still singing. The child screamed when the soldier
struck it with his bayonet, but not afterwards."</p>

<h2>4. BRUTAL TREATMENT OF THE AGED,
THE CRIPPLED AND THE INFIRM.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p>At <i>Denée</i>, on August 28th, a Belgian soldier who had been
taken prisoner saw three civilian fellow-prisoners shot. One
was a cripple and another an old man of 80, who was paralysed.
It was alleged by two German soldiers that these men had shot
at them with rifles. Neither of them had rifles, nor had they
anything in their pockets. The witness actually saw the Germans
search them and nothing was found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">20</div>

<p><i>Louvain.</i>&mdash;"Subsequently my master&mdash;an old gentleman&mdash;was
bayoneted and shot."... Among other persons whose
houses were burnt was an old man of 90, lying dangerously ill,
who was taken out on his mattress and left lying in his garden
all night. He died shortly after in the hospital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18</div>

<p>The journey to Louvain is thus described by a witness:
"We were all marched off to Louvain, walking. There were some
very old people, amongst others a man 90 years of age. The
very old people were drawn in carts and barrows by the younger
men. There was an officer with a bicycle, who shouted, as
people fell out by the side of the road, 'Shoot them.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">8</div>

<p>At <i>Heure le Romain</i> ... some bedridden old men were
imprisoned in the church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p><i>Andenne.</i>&mdash;A paralytic was murdered in his garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29</div>

<p><i>Beaumetz.</i>&mdash;They saw two old men&mdash;between 60 and 70 years
of age&mdash;and one old woman lying close to each other in the
garden. All three had the scalps cut right through....
They were still bleeding.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>5. THE USE OF CIVILIANS AS SCREENS.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">33</div>

<p>The Committee had before them a considerable body of
evidence with reference to the practice of the Germans of using
civilians and sometimes military prisoners as screens from behind
which they could fire upon the Belgian troops, in the hope that
the Belgians would not return the fire for fear of killing or
wounding their own fellow-countrymen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">31</div>

<p>The use of women and even children as a screen for the protection
of the German troops is referred to.... From the
number of troops concerned, it must have been commanded or
acquiesced in by officers, and in some cases the presence and
connivance of officers is proved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p><i>Termonde.</i>&mdash;Two hundred civilians were utilised as a screen
by the German troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24</div>

<p><i>Binnenstraat.</i>&mdash;The civilians were utilised on Saturday, the
26th September, as a screen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">33</div>

<p><i>Mons.</i>&mdash;On August 24th men, women and children were
actually pushed into the front of the German position outside
Mons. The witness speaks of 16 to 20 women, about a dozen
children and half a dozen men being there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">34</div>

<p>At <i>Tournai</i> 400 Belgian civilians&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;were
placed in front of the Germans, who then engaged the
French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">34</div>

<p>At <i>Ypres</i> the Germans drove women in front of them by
pricking them with bayonets. The wounds were afterwards
seen by the witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">34</div>

<p>At <i>Londerzeel</i> 30 or 40 civilians&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;were
placed at the head of a German column.</p>

<p>One witness from <i>Termonde</i> was made to stand in front of
the Germans, together with others, all with their hands above
their heads. Those who allowed their hands to drop were at
once prodded with the bayonet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>6. THE KILLING OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS
AND PRISONERS.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">35</div>

<p>After making all allowances, there remain certain instances
in which it is clear that quarter was refused to persons desiring
to surrender when it ought to have been given, or that persons
already so wounded as to be incapable of fighting further, were
wantonly shot or bayoneted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">36</div>

<p>In one case, given very circumstantially, a witness [a British
lance-corporal, whose evidence has been confirmed by a lieutenant
and a private] tells how a party of wounded British soldiers were
left in a chalk pit, all very badly hurt, and quite unable to make
resistance. One of them, an officer, held up his handkerchief
as a white flag, and this "attracted the attention of a party of
about eight Germans. The Germans came to the edge of the
pit. It was getting dusk, but the light was still good, and everything
clearly discernible. One of them, who appeared to be
carrying no arms, and who, at any rate, had no rifle, came a few
feet down the slope into the chalk pit, within eight or ten yards
of some of the wounded men." He looked at the men, laughed,
and said something in German to the Germans who were waiting
on the edge of the pit. Immediately one of them fired at the
officer, then three or four of these 10 soldiers were shot, then
another officer, and the witness, and the rest of them. "After
an interval of some time I sat up and found that I was the only
man of the 10 who were living when the Germans came into the
pit remaining alive, and that all the rest were dead."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>7. LOOTING, BURNING AND DESTRUCTION
OF PROPERTY.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">34</div>

<p>There is an overwhelming mass of evidence of the deliberate
destruction of private property by the German soldiers. The
destruction, in most cases, was effected by fire, and the German
troops had been provided beforehand with appliances for rapidly
setting fire to houses. Among the appliances enumerated by
witnesses are syringes for squirting petrol, guns for throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
small inflammable bombs, and small pellets made of inflammable
material. Specimens of the last-mentioned have been shown
to members of the Committee. Besides burning houses the
Germans frequently smashed furniture and pictures; they also
broke in doors and windows. Frequently, too, they defiled houses
by relieving the wants of nature upon the floor. They also appear
to have perpetrated the same vileness upon piled up heaps of
provisions, so as to destroy what they could not themselves
consume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25</div>

<p>Villages, even large parts of a city, were given to the flames as
part of the terrorising policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">35</div>

<p>The general conclusion is that the burning and destruction of
property which took place was only in a very small minority of
cases justified by military necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p><i>Louvain.</i>&mdash;Then the corps of incendiaries got to work. They
had broad belts with the words "Gott mit uns" ("God with
us"), and their equipment consisted of a hatchet, a syringe, a
small shovel and a revolver. Fires blazed up in the direction of
the Law Courts and St. Martin's Barracks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19</div>

<p>A witness: "When we got to the Place de la Station ...
not a single house in the place was standing."</p>

<div class="sidenote">20</div>

<p>On the 26th (Wednesday), in the city of Louvain, massacre,
fire, and destruction went on. The University, with its Library,
the Church of St. Peter, and many houses were set on fire and
burnt to the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12</div>

<p><i>Tamines.</i>&mdash;A witness went there on August 27th and says:
"It is absolutely destroyed and a mass of ruins."</p>

<div class="sidenote">9</div>

<p><i>Liège.</i>&mdash;The Rue des Pitteurs and houses in the Place de
l'Université and the Quai des Pêcheurs were systematically fired
with benzine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16</div>

<p><i>Aerschot.</i>&mdash;The houses were set on fire with special apparatus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12</div>

<p><i>Montigny-sur-Sambre.</i>&mdash;Incendiaries, with a distinctive badge
on their arm, went down the main street throwing handfuls of
inflammatory and explosive pastilles into the houses. These
pastilles were carried by them in bags, and in this way about
130 houses were destroyed in the main street.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11</div>

<p><i>Namur.</i>&mdash;A witness of good standing ... describes how
the town was set on fire systematically in six different places....
Not less than 140 houses were burnt. On the 25th the
hospital was set on fire with inflammable pastilles, the pretext
being that soldiers in the hospital had fired upon the Germans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13</div>

<p><i>Dinant.</i>&mdash;The town was systematically set on fire by hand
grenades.... The houses and villages were pillaged and
property wantonly destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12</div>

<p>At <i>Morlanwelz</i>, about this time, the British Army, together
with some French cavalry, were compelled to retire before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
German troops. The latter took the burgomaster and his manservant
prisoner and shot them both in front of the Hotel de
Ville at Péronne (Belgium), where the bodies were left in the
street for 48 hours. They burnt the Hotel de Ville and 62 houses.
The usual accusation of firing by civilians was made. It is
strenuously denied by the witness, who declares that three or
four days before the arrival of the Germans, circulars had been
distributed to every house and placards had been posted in the
town ordering the deposit of all firearms at the Hotel de Ville,
and that this order had been complied with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24</div>

<p><i>Erpe.</i>&mdash;The village was deliberately burnt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23</div>

<p><i>Termonde.</i>&mdash;The town was partially burnt. One witness was
taken prisoner in the street by some German soldiers, together
with several other civilians. At about 12 o'clock on the 5th some
of the tallest and strongest men amongst the prisoners were
picked out to go round the streets with paraffin. Three or four
carts containing paraffin tanks were brought up, and a syringe
was used to put paraffin on to the houses, which were then fired.
The process of destruction began with the houses of rich people,
and afterwards the houses of the poorer classes were treated in
the same manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8</div>

<p><i>Herve.</i>&mdash;From the 8th to the 10th over 300 houses were burnt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8</div>

<p><i>Visé.</i>&mdash;On or about the 14th and 15th the village was completely
destroyed. Officers directed the incendiaries, who worked
methodically with benzine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9</div>

<p><i>Diary of Eitel Anders</i>, a German soldier.&mdash;"We crossed the
Belgian frontier on August 15th, 1914, at 11.50 in the forenoon,
and then we went steadily along the main road till we got
into Belgium. Hardly were we there when we had a horrible
sight. Houses were burnt down.... Not one of the
hundreds of houses were spared. Everything was plundered and
burnt."</p>

<div class="sidenote">24</div>

<p><i>Diary of Matbern, of the 4th Company of Jägers</i>, states that at
a village between Birnal and Dinant, on Sunday, August 23rd,
"about 220 inhabitants were shot, and the village was burnt....
All villages, chateaux and houses are burnt down during
the night. It is a beautiful sight to see the fires all round us in
the distance."</p>


<p><i>Looting.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">34</div>

<p>The German troops, both in Belgium and France, are proved
to have been guilty of persistent looting. In the majority of
cases the looting took place from houses, but there is also evidence
that German soldiers, and even officers, robbed their prisoners,
both civil and military, of sums of money and other portable
possessions. It was apparently well known throughout the
German Army that towns and villages would be burned whenever
it appeared that any civilians had fired upon the German
troops, and there is reason to suspect that this known intention
of the German military authorities in some cases explains the
sequence of events which led up to the burning and sacking of a
town or village. The soldiers, knowing that they would have
an opportunity of plunder if the place was condemned, had a
motive for arranging some incident which would provide the
necessary excuse for condemnation. More than one witness
alleges that shots coming from the window of a house were fired
by German soldiers, who had forced their way into the house
for the purpose of thus creating an alarm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">15</div>

<p><i>Aerschot.</i>&mdash;Throughout the day the town was looted by the
soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8</div>

<p><i>Visé.</i>&mdash;Antiques and china were removed from the houses

revolver in hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>FINDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">37</div>

<p>"The Committee have come to a definite conclusion upon
each of the heads under which the evidence has been classified.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<b>It is proved</b>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(<b>i</b>) <b>That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate
and systematically organised massacres of the civil
population, accompanied by many isolated murders
and other outrages.</b></p>

<p>"(<b>ii</b>) <b>That in the conduct of the war generally innocent
civilians, both men and women, were murdered in
large numbers, women violated, and children
murdered.</b></p>

<p>"(<b>iii</b>) <b>That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction
of property were ordered and countenanced by
the officers of the German Army, that elaborate
provision had been made for systematic incendiarism
at the very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings
and destruction were frequent where no military
necessity could be alleged, being indeed part of a
system of general terrorization.</b></p>

<p>"(<b>iv</b>) <b>That the rules and usages of war were frequently
broken, particularly by the using of civilians,
including women and children, as a shield for
advancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree
by killing the wounded and prisoners, and in the
frequent abuse of the Red Cross and the White Flag.</b></p>

<p>"Sensible as they are of the gravity of these conclusions, the
Committee conceive that they would be doing less than their
duty if they failed to record them as fully established by the
evidence. <b>Murder, lust, and pillage prevailed over many parts
of Belgium on a scale unparalleled in any war between civilised
nations during the last three centuries.</b></p>

<p>"Our function is ended when we have stated what the evidence
establishes, but we may be permitted to express our belief that
these disclosures will not have been made in vain if they touch
and rouse the conscience of mankind, and we venture to hope
that, as soon as the present war is over, the nations of the world
in council will consider what means can be provided and sanctions
devised to prevent the recurrence of such horrors as our generation
is now witnessing."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Is YOUR conscience roused? Won't YOU
take the most effective way of showing it&mdash;if
you are a man under 40 and fit? The only
way to put a stop to these and other crimes is
to crush the German Army.</p>

<p>YOU can help either by joining the Army
or by making munitions. Place YOUR services
at the disposal of the military authorities.</p>

<p>If YOU are a woman, cannot you help a
man to decide?</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
